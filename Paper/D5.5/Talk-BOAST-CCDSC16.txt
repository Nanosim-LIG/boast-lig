Title: BOAST: a Metaprogramming Framework to Produce Portable and Efficient Computing Kernels for HPC Applications

Abstract: The portability of real HPC applications on new platforms is an open and very delicate problem. The performance portability of the underlying computing kernels is especially problematic as these kernels need to be tuned for each and every platform the application encounters. In this talk, we will present BOAST, a metaprogramming framework dedicated computing kernels.  BOAST allows the description of a kernel and its possible optimizations using a DSL. BOAST runtime will then compare the different versions' performance as well as verify their exactness. BOAST is applied to three use cases: a Laplace kernel in OpenCL, and two HPC applications BigDFT (electronic density computation) and SPECFEM3D (seismic and wave propagation).
